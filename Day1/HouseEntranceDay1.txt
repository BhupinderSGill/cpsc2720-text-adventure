You wake up after your long ride home. The bus drops you off at your house.
In Dandy Ville
Hearing a loud buzzing coming from your room you house. You wonder what it could
be and head inside.
You quickly realize that your parents, who are on vacation, must have left the 
radio on and you hear, "There is much controversy behind The corporation's 
actions. It’s highly likely that the Fallen Apple Sector will be demolished."

Surprised you say out loud, "But I live in the Fallen Apple Sector."
You are in your kitchen, and you feel your stomach growl.
