Things that have happened:
You decide to get some milk,#ifHaveItem#Eggs#a carton of eggs,# #ifHaveItem#Cereal#cereal, #a can of cola and a box of tic tacs. 
As you approach the counter you notice that the teller looks quite dirty.
You notice as he rings you through that his hair is standing on end 
flowing in every which direction like he was an electrocuted cartoon character.

He grabs your hand and looks you in the eye right after you pay for your groceries 
and says," Have you heard about the Corporation?

#ifHaveItem#ResponceToParanoia#What! How is this possible? You have lived in this town just as long as i have!
No matter. The Corporation has been polluting The Lake, destroying the Forrest, robing me of my Bed, nowhere is safe.
They could even be in your house right now eating your bread.
He seems completely insane but also quite genuine with his concern.
You keep what he said in mind.
You're about to walk away when he asks if you have heard about the corporation.#
