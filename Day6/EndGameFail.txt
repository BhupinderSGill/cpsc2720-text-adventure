You present the documents, that Mr. Paranoia risked his life for
to the court. Undeniable proof of the evil schemes of the CEO bribing a politician
to allow him to build a golf course.

CEO: "I knew you were the one who broke into my office! How dare you try to foil my plan!"

>The town gasps.
>The judge seems to be siding with you a bit.

Your Uncle does not look comfortable, and stays silent.
