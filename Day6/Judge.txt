	I have come to the conclusion that the CEO is corrupt and does not have good intentions.
	His plan to building a golf course here has been rejected. Thank you."#
#ifHaveItem#!Documents#Judge: "Seeing the overwhelming support from the town, to gather
	together for the same cause. I have no choice but to side with them on this
	issue. Mr. CEO, you may not go with your plan to demolish the old town of Dandyville."#

CEO: "WHAT? How can you do that! You know how much money I spent on this?!"

The town celebrated their victory for the rest of the day.
They all went to the festival and fully enjoyed themselves.
