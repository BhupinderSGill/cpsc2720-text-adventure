Construction Worker: "Despite my position, I am siding with the town. It is common knowledge among us workers
	that the CEO has definitely bribed a politician."
CEO: "I PAY YOU. YOU'RE FIRED!"#

#ifHaveItem#Petition#>You bring forth the petition, that you worked hard to gather signatures for.
Judge: "You do not have enough support from the town...
	It seems most of them approve of the new golf course.
	Your case is being thrown out."#
#ifHaveItem#!Petition#Judge: "It is clear you have no support from the town"
	It seems all of them approve of the new golf course.
	I have no reason to deny the CEO.
	Your case is being thrown out."#

Judge: "Thank you."
