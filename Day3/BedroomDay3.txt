You wake up to a familiar ceiling, your bedroom. Your clothing are still littered all around.
#ifHaveItem#!PlayVideogamesDay3#In the corner of your room, you see your video game console and CRT television. 
It is giving you the urge to do nothing, but play for the day.#
#ifHaveItem#!NewspaperDay3#The newspaper is there as usual, however it's kind of strange today.#
You notice you're still having a difficult time keeping your eyes open, maybe a jog will help wake you up.
*Ring* Ring* The phone seems to be ringing from the nightstand beside your bed.
The Caller ID on the little LCD screen on the cordless displays "Mr. Paranoia".

#ifHaveItem#PlayVideogamesDay3#>Need to finish this game, so you play for a little while. Got frustrated and gave up.#
#ifHaveItem#NapDay3#>You attempted to get 5 more minutes before starting your day, but the phone ringing kept you awake.#
#ifHaveItem#NewspaperDay3#>You're still impressed that the paper delivered first thing in the morning. You read the headline, "Get Over the Hump". You seem to be having a good start already."#
