You get into your jog suit and lace up your running shoes.
The sun shines brightly down on you as you step outside.

While on a job around the block, you run into a kid.
Hmmmm... you think you might recognize him.
As you get closer you realize it is your cousin, Zack.
He's looking at you with a purpose. You hear him yell "It's about Mr. Paranoia!!"

#ifHaveItem#TalkToCousinDay3#>Zack: "Hey! You wouldn't guess, but a lot of the kids are freaking the hell out right now! Apparently Mr. Paranoia is planning to steal something from the big Corporation Building..."#
#ifHaveItem#TalkToCousinDay3#>Huh... you wonder why he would do that, you decide to go back home and call him."#
