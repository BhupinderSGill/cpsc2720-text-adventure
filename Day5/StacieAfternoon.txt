The sun is high overhead.

You knock and your Aunt Stacie Answers.

You can hear a television in the background.

"And the system may not be perfect,
but it is better than any other possibility. If
you work hard, then you can get ahead. If you are
not for us, you are against us."

Stacie refuses to sign and seems to think you are crazy.
