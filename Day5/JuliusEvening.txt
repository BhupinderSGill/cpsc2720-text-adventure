You can see the sunset.

You knock on Julius' door.
Julius opens the door and gives you a questioning look.

Julius> What's the big deal?

You> Mr. CEO is is trying to get a project
to go ahead in Dandy Ville which was already rejected by the courts
one time. I'm collecting signatures of people against the project.

Julius> Oh ya that thing. I'll sign.

Julius signs the petition
