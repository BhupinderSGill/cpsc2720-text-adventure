Mom> Hello. Mom speaking.

You> Hi mom (sob). Something terrible happened.

Mom> Sweetie what is is?

You> My house is going to be demolished.

Mom> Sweetie that's terrible. But a mature person looks
on the positive side of things. I hear the CEO is going
to build a golf course in the town.

You> Mom I don't want a golf course. I want a place to live.

Mom> Sometimes we can't have what we want. But staying positive
will make things seem better. You should trust your Mom.

You> Goodnight Mom

Mom> Goodnight Sweetie.

You hand up.
