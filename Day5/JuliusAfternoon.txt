Julius opens the door and gives you a questioning look.#
#ifHaveItem#JuliusKnock#You BANG on Julius' door until he answers

Julius> What's the big deal?#

You> Mr. CEO is is trying to get a project
to go ahead in Dandy Ville which was already rejected by the courts
one time. I'm collecting signatures of people against the project.

Julius> Oh ya that thing. I'll sign.

Julius signs the petition#ifHaveItem#JuliusKnock# and shuts the door quickly.#
