The Reminder - Friday, April 19
April 19 has been a day of tradition in Dandy Ville for many years.
This is the day we add the date to our newspaper!

We strongly recommend that you clean your room today in preparation
for festivities this Saturday.

The corporation will be appealing the last court decision regarding
some classified business activities this Sunday. While we can't get into
specifics due to the gag law. The Judge has invited the citizens
of Dandy Ville to testify on behalf of the town. Any citizens wishing to
testify will need to fill out this petition and bring it to the trial.
